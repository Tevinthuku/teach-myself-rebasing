# teach-myself-rebasing

This demo will teach me on rebasing

## D will also be here

And the bottom as well

## Thinking of B here

Would want to have B here, then handle A after C.

## Lets start with feature C

C is a good Letter, then we'll refactor the rest to fit the model.

## Also use the first one with respect to the second one.

## This is feature A coming real soon, just some auth.

## Both feature A and B

Will be working on Feature A & B together.

## This is feature A.

Will be adding a few comments here and there

## This is also Feature B.

Will be adding a few things here too.

## Point C will also be here.

Let's clean this repo up so that POint C can be at the bottom.
## D will also be here

This is also an endpoint for handling D.
## This is feature A.

Will be adding a few comments here and there
